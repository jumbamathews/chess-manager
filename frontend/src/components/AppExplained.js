            <h4>First use: steps to follow</h4>
            <ul>

                <li>Create a tournament and add 8 players to it.</li>
                <li>Lock the tournament to create the first round and associated matches. Tournament attributes are no longer editable after lockout.</li>
                <li>The first round page is accessible on the tournament page, on which are accessible the pages of the associated matches.</li>
                <li>On the page of a match, click on the insert of one of the 2 players to designate a winner or click on the "Tie" insert in the event of a draw.</li>
                <li>Click on the "validate" button to lock the match. The outcome of a match is no longer modifiable after being locked.</li>
                <li>Once the 4 matches are locked, the next round is automatically created.</li>

            </ul>
            <h4>game system</h4>
            <p>Players are matched according to two algorithms, inspired by the Swiss gaming system :</p>
            <ul>
                <li>During the first round, players are sorted according to their rank. The list of players is then cut in 2 and the 1st player from the 1st list is associated with the 1st player from the 2nd list, etc..</li>
                <li>During the following rounds, the players are sorted according to their number of points, then according to their rank in the event of a tie. The 1st player on the list is then associated with the 2nd player. If the 2 players have already faced each other, the 1st player is associated with the 3rd, etc....</li>
            </ul>
            <p>At the end of a tournament, the new rank of each player is calculated according to the average place of all the tournaments or the number of tournaments won.</p>
